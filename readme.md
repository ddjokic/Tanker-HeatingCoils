<h4>Tanker - Heating Coils</h4>

Script calculates heating requirements of cargo oil (crude, chemicals, etc) in order to get pumped from tanks. Typical usage is for sea (or rvier) going tankers.</p>
Enter steam properties, cargo ("oil") properties and characteristics of the tanks and their neighboring tanks and you are good to go.</p>
<h5>Input</h5>
Input can be minimized by "hand" editing default valuse in the script and calling them by typing '0' once you are asked to input values.</p>
<h6>Tank groupig</h6>
Typical tanker consist of identical tanks. Moreover, as a rule, tanks are always symmetrical arroung longitudinal axis of the tanker</p>
Typical Aframax tanker (approx. 100,000 t) consist of 12 cargo tanks + 2 "slop" tanks, which can be used for cargo storage. In total, 14 tanks. It is large number of tanks and huge input for operator. Grouping allows to reduce input - one group for two formost tanks, one group for 8 mid-tanks, one for aft cargo tanks and one for two slop-tanks. By introducing grouping, daunting task of input for 14 tanks is reduced to, more moderate, 4 groups.</p>
<h5>Output</h5>
Upon execution, input and output of calculation will be written to "projectname.txt" file in same folder in which script is located.</p>
<h5>Disclaimer</h5>
Script served me well on several projects and results had been confirmed on sea-trials and, later, in operation. It is not related to you - you can have different experience, for various reasons. Hence, this script comes without **any warranty**, even without warranty that it is "fit for the purpose." You are using it on your own risk.<p>
